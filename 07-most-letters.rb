# Write a method that takes a string in and returns true if the letter
# "z" appears within three letters **after** an "a". You may assume
# that the string contains only lowercase letters.
#
# Difficulty: medium.

#search for the "a" if you find an a, have true conditions if next three spots in array have z. otherwise move on to next a,
# done going through string. then print false.

# your solution, they should all print true.
